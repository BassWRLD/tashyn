<p>
<u><ol><font size = "5"> 11. Educate Employees (for organizations):</u></ol></font>
<p>
Organize regular security awareness training for employees. Provide specific examples and guidelines for identifying and handling potential phishing attempts.<br/>
<p>
<u><ol><font size = "5">12. Report and Delete Suspicious Content:</u></ol></font>
<p>
If you suspect an email is a phishing attempt, report it to your email provider or organization's IT department. Delete the suspicious email to prevent accidental interaction or future exposure to its contents.<br/>
<p>
By implementing these practices and fostering a security-conscious mindset, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce their susceptibility to phishing attacks. Regular education and the promotion of cybersecurity best practices play a vital role in mitigating the risk of falling victim to phishing attempts.








<u><h3>What is CYBERCRIME?</h3></u><br/>
<p>
Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device, or a network. While most cybercrimes are conducted to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are conducted against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them. Cybercrime refers to criminal activities carried out using digital technology or the internet. It encompasses a wide range of illegal activities committed in cyberspace, targeting computer systems, networks, or personal devices, with the intent to cause harm, steal data, or generate financial gain. Cybercrimes can take various forms, including hacking, identity theft, phishing, malware distribution, ransomware attacks, online fraud, cyberbullying, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and more. These illicit activities often target individuals, businesses, organizations, or even entire nations, aiming to disrupt systems, compromise data, extort money, or cause damage. Cybercrime poses significant risks to personal privacy, financial security, critical infrastructure, and national security, making it a critical area of concern for individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. Efforts to combat cybercrime involve cybersecurity measures, law enforcement actions, international cooperation, and public awareness campaigns to prevent and mitigate the impact of these digital offenses. As technology advances, the landscape of cybercrime also evolves, posing new challenges that require ongoing vigilance and innovative strategies to protect against such threats. <br/>
<p>
<u><h3>How does IDENTITY THEFT work in a CYBERCRIME?</h3></u><br/>
<p>
Online identity theft refers to the attacker&#39;s use of online platforms to steal identities and commit online fraud. This can range from attacks on a user&#39;s social media account or e-commerce platform. Identity theft in cybercrime occurs when an individual's personal information is unlawfully obtained and used by someone else for fraudulent purposes. Here's how it typically works:<br/>
<ol>
<h4>Data Breaches or Hacking:</h4> </ol><br/>
Cybercriminals often acquire personal information through data breaches. They may hack into databases of companies, financial institutions, or government agencies to steal sensitive data like names, addresses, social security numbers, credit card details, or login credentials.<br/>
<ol>
<h4>Phishing and Social Engineering:</h4> </ol><br/>
Identity thieves use phishing emails, messages, or phone calls to trick individuals into revealing personal information. These communications may appear legitimate, asking for login details or personal data under false pretenses.<br/>
<ol>
<h4>Malware and Skimming:</h4></ol><br/>
Malware, such as keyloggers or spyware, can be used to capture sensitive information entered on infected devices. Skimming devices installed on ATMs or point-of-sale terminals can also collect credit card information.<br/>
<ol>
<h4>Fake Websites or Cloning:</h4> </ol><br/>
Cybercriminals create fake websites or clone legitimate ones to trick users into entering their personal information. These fake sites may look almost identical to the real ones, leading individuals to unknowingly provide their data.<br/>
<ol>
<h4>Dark Web and Sale of Stolen Information:</h4></ol><br/>
Stolen personal data is often sold on the dark web to other criminals who use it for various fraudulent purposes, from opening credit accounts to committing financial fraud.<br/>
<p>
<u>Once the personal information is obtained, cybercriminals can use it in several ways:</u><br/>
<p>
<ol>
<h4>Financial Fraud:</h4> </ol><br/>
They may open bank accounts, apply for credit cards, or make unauthorized transactions using the stolen information.<br/>
<ol>
<h4>Identity Cloning:</h4></ol><br/>
Cybercriminals can assume the identity of the victim, using their information for various purposes, such as committing crimes or obtaining false documents.<br/>
<ol>
<h4>Tax Fraud:</h4></ol><br/>
Stolen social security numbers or personal details can be used to file fraudulent tax returns to claim refunds.<br/>
<p>
To prevent identity theft, individuals should take measures like using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, being cautious with personal information online, regularly monitoring financial accounts for unusual activity, and being aware of common phishing and scam tactics.<br/>
<p>
<u><h3>How does HACKING and PHISHING work in a CYBERCRIME?</h3></u><br/>
<p>
The process of attempting to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in its security is called hacking. Hacking specifically refers to same as cracking, but with criminal intent. Hacking and phishing are common techniques used in cybercrimes. Here's an overview of how each method works:<br/>
<p>
<ul><h4>Hacking:</h4></ul><br/>

Hacking involves gaining unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. This is often done by exploiting vulnerabilities in software, systems, or networks. Here's how it works:<br/>
<p>
<ol>1.	<h5>Identifying Vulnerabilities:</h5></ol><br/>
Hackers seek out weaknesses in software, hardware, or networks that they can exploit to gain access. Vulnerabilities may exist in outdated software, unsecured network connections, or poor system configurations.<br/>
<p>
<ol>2.	<h5>Exploiting Security Weaknesses:</h5></ol><br/>
Hackers use various tools, techniques, or malware to exploit these vulnerabilities. They might use software vulnerabilities, brute force attacks (trying multiple passwords), or social engineering tactics to trick individuals into giving up access details.<br/>
<p>
<ol>3.	<h5>Gaining Unauthorized Access:</h5></ol><br/>
Once the hacker successfully exploits a vulnerability, they can gain access to the system or network. This access can be used to steal data, disrupt operations, install malware, or even take control of the entire system.<br/>
<p>
<ul><h4>Phishing:</h4></ul><br/>
<p>
Phishing is a social engineering technique used to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial data, or personal information. It often involves fraudulent emails or messages. Here's how it works:<br/>
<p>
<ol>1.	<h5>Creating Deceptive Communications:</h5></ol><br/>
Cybercriminals craft emails, messages, or even phone calls that appear to come from reputable sources, such as banks, government agencies, or well-known companies. The messages often contain urgent requests or alarming scenarios.<br/>
<p>
<ol>2.	<h5>Tricking Individuals:</h5></ol><br/>
The messages often contain links to fake websites that closely resemble legitimate ones, or they may ask recipients to provide personal information by replying to the message.<br/>
<p>
<ol>3.	<h5>Acquiring Sensitive Information:</h5></ol><br/>
If individuals fall for the scam and provide their information, cybercriminals can use it for fraudulent activities, including identity theft, financial fraud, or gaining unauthorized access to accounts.<br/>
<p>
Both hacking and phishing rely on exploiting human and system vulnerabilities. Mitigating these risks involves using strong security measures, keeping systems updated, using firewalls and antivirus software, and educating individuals about recognizing and avoiding potential threats like suspicious emails or links. Regular employee training and cybersecurity awareness can significantly reduce the risks associated with hacking and phishing.<br/>

Phones were the most common primary device among the respondents.<br/>
<p></p>
<h4>Operating Systems:</h4>

Both iOS (Apple) and Android OS were used across different devices, with a mix of operating systems among the respondents.
This data provides insights into the frequency of hacking experiences among different age groups, primary devices, and operating systems used by the respondents. It's evident that a significant portion of respondents has encountered hacking incidents, predominantly using Android devices. The dataset provides insights into individuals' experiences with hacking, categorized by age groups, primary devices, and operating systems. A significant proportion of respondents, 21 out of 29, reported not having been hacked, suggesting robust cybersecurity practices or a stroke of good fortune. However, 8 individuals reported being hacked, with various frequencies ranging from once to multiple occurrences. 3 out of 8 individuals experienced hacking multiple times, potentially indicating vulnerabilities in their cybersecurity measures or the increased attractiveness of their data to cybercriminals.
A correlation emerges between the frequency of hacking and the choice of operating system. A notable majority of respondents who experienced hacking were using AndroidOS, while 10 were on iOS (Apple). This distribution suggests differing levels of susceptibility or security vulnerabilities between the two operating systems. Individuals aged 41-50 seem more susceptible to hacking, representing the highest frequency of reported incidents. The prevalence of smartphones as the primary device across age groups underlines the significance of securing these devices, given their widespread use for various online activities and communication.

The dataset also reveals intriguing patterns in hacking experiences across diverse demographics, primary devices, and operating systems. It suggests a disparity in hacking incidents between users of different operating systems, suggesting a potential need for heightened security measures, user education, and vigilance, particularly within the Android ecosystem. The prevalence of hacking incidents appears more concentrated among the age group of 41-50, indicating an increased vulnerability due to various factors.

		<a><b><u>Below is and adaptation from the already published article <i>Cyber crime: A review of the evidence Chapter 4: Improving the cyber crime evidence base Home Office Research Report 75 October 2013 Dr. Mike McGuire (University of Surrey) and Samantha Dowling (Home Office Science)</i></u></b></a>

<h3>Challenges of the cyber crime evidence base</h3>
<p></p>
<font color = "blueviolet"><h3>Cybercrime is a complex issue. Some of the main challenges in improving the
understanding of cybercrime are as follows:</font></h3><br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>Lack of recording mechanisms that accurately distinguish between online and offline
crime.</h4><p></p><img src = "filler7.jpg" align = "right" width = "500" height = "250">
Police recorded crime does not distinguish between online and offline offences, making it difficult to identify cybercrimes. Police record crime in accordance with the provisions of the Home Office Counting Rules (HOCR), which set out that the crime to be recorded, is determined by the law. Since there is no specific offence (or offences) of cybercrime – aside from those specified in the Computer Misuse Act 1990 – police recorded crime does not distinguish between online and offline offences. Whether or not the offence was committed online or offline, is cyber-enabled or cyber-dependent, the offence recorded is based on the offence in law. For example, a fraud committed using a computer would usually be recorded as a fraud under police recorded crime before the roll out of Action Fraud as the national reporting centre for fraud and financially motivated cybercrime, computer misuse and fraud offences were recorded by individual police forces. Action Fraud completed roll out in April 2013 and has since taken responsibility for the recording of all fraud and computer misuse offences. Action Fraud captures reports from public and businesses on these offences and classifies them in a way which allows distinctions to be made between computer misuse, online fraud, and offline fraud offences. Action Fraud also assesses them against the provisions of the law and the requirements of HOCR. Where a report falls short of being recorded as a crime under HOCR, Action Fraud has the facility to record it as an incident, for intelligence and information purposes.</li><br/>

<h4><li>Under-reporting of cybercrime, from both the public and business; and a lack of
awareness that some cyber incidents are crimes.</h4><p></p>
Cybercrimes are under-reported, for example, recent findings from the Commercial Victimisation Survey (CVS; Home Office, 2013) suggest that just two percent of online crime incidents were reported to the police by businesses. This is lower than for other crime types, for example, one hundred per cent of vehicle theft incidents and over 80 per cent of burglary with entry incidents were reported to the police in the same survey. Non-reporting of cybercrimes was due to incidents being perceived as too trivial and being dealt with in-house (bearing in mind that three-quarters of incidents were related to viruses). There are also likely to be concerns from businesses about reputational damage and negative publicity, which prevent reporting, reveal a similar picture for members of the public. For example, just 1 percent of adult internet users who experienced hacking or unauthorised access to their data in the 12 months prior to the survey reported this to the police. This compared with 81 percent who reported a burglary and 55 per cent who reported a robbery. Under-reporting may occur for a number of reasons:</li><br/>
<p></p>
1*<ul> Perceptions that the police will not/cannot do anything about online crimes not knowing where to report.</ul><img src = "filler8.jpeg" align = "right">
2*<ul> Reporting to other bodies such as banks or internet service providers.</ul>
3*<ul> Perceptions that cybercrimes are not ‘real’ crimes like, for example, vehicle theft or burglary.</ul>
4*<ul> Victims not realising or perceiving themselves as victims, for example, because a bank has refunded lost money, or being unaware that malware has infected them computer and stolen their personal details.</ul>
5*<ul>Some victims simply being too embarrassed to come forward, for example, regarding common frauds.</ul>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>Inconsistencies in the measurement and definition of cybercrime within the relevant
research.</h4><p></p>

Cybercrime data are often categorised and measured in diverse ways across different sources, with various (or even no) definitions. This limits an ability to apply and compare findings. The multifaceted nature of cybercrime means that there are various units of measurement that could be considered, for example:<br/>
<p></p><img src = "filler9.jpg" align = "right" width = "500" height = "250">
♣<ul>Number of incidents or crimes.</ul>
♣<ul>Levels of ‘harms or costs.</ul>
♣<ul>Individual or business victims.</ul>
♣<ul>Private or public sectors.</ul>
♣<ul>Awareness levels or actual experiences.</ul>
<p></p>
These measures will also differ depending on which form of cybercrime is of most interest.
There are challenges with industry-based reports for cyber-dependent-crimes.</li><br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>Information from industry sources often lacks transparency and comparability.</h4><p></p>

Cybercrime data are dominated by reports from the security industry, for example, antivirus (AV) providers. Whilst these sources are useful for understanding the nature of threats posed; they should be viewed with caution given the lack of transparency in how AV providers calculate their estimates of infections and attacks – it is often unclear what is being counted and how this has been done. John Viega, Vice-President of the US Perimeter E-Security company, summarises the technical challenges and ways in which industry reports can over-inflate the scale of malware.</h4><br/>

He concludes that “the reality is the problem isn’t as big as we think – but we don’t really have a good way of quantifying it” (Viega, 2012, p 15). There is also a lack of comparability between reports from different providers. For example, different AV producers/reports may adopt:</ol>
τ<ol>Different names for malware families and the variants or strains of these in their enumerations.</ol>
τ<ol>Different units of measurement, such as unique incidents, whether malware is ‘in the wild’ versus those that are confined to AV laboratories, zero-day attacks, detections and removals from AV systems.</ol>
τ<ol>Different geographical and customer base coverage</ol>
τ<ol>Ill-defined terms (such as ‘attacks’), along with a lack of transparency in how figures are produced and their implications for the wider public.</ol><br/>

Most reports often present an international picture and there is limited evidence about the UK specifically. Furthermore, concerns have also been raised about the possible vested interests of these companies in selling security products when reporting these figures and the British Society of Computing (BSC) recommended ‘caution’ with use of industry figures suggests that 1 For example, one ‘core’ piece of malware can show up hundreds of thousands of times in a vendor’s system, and few vendors try to state how many ‘core’ pieces of malware there are a year (Viega suggests thousands not millions). There is a need to put the “science back into computer science” and recommends more robust and publicly verifiable experimental approaches and use of statistical methods when testing security features.</li><br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>Few methodologically sound surveys of victims exist.</h4><br/>
<p></p>
Aside from a few exceptions, for example, the CSEW and the Oxford Internet Institute surveys (see ONS, 2012; Dutton and Blank, 2013), surveys of victims are often based on small, unrepresentative samples, from which inferences to the wider population cannot be made. In some cases, the exact survey methodology is also difficult to verify. However, methodologically robust surveys such as the CSEW have other limitations:</li><p></p>
<p></p>
ƒ<ul>In terms of the depth and range of questions asked (as cyber questions are just one part of a larger crime survey)</ul>
ƒ<ul>Because the incidents reported relate to ‘negative online experiences’ rather than criminal activity per se (these experiences would often not be classed as ‘crimes’ under the usual Home Office Counting Rules). </ul><br/>
<p></p>
Surveys of victims more generally will always be limited by individuals knowing that they have been victimised and understanding what has happened to them – for example, identifying if they were victim of a phishing attack, a virus, or a hack. Distinguishing between these methods of attack and related outcomes such as fraud, is likely to be difficult.
<p></p>
Surveys of monetary loss can be particularly challenging to interpret. As outlined by Florencio and Herley (2011) many of the survey-based estimates of loss that have been undertaken to date face a number of common issues. These include the use of unverified self-reports, the inclusion of high-value single outliers, which heavily skew and exaggerate results, and the reliance on a handful of respondents to formulate the majority of the estimate. This can then lead to inappropriate extrapolation of grossed-up findings to the wider population.</li><br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>Cybercrime is global in nature. It is not constrained by national boundaries.</h4>
<p></p>
Cybercrime offences and their perpetrators may originate outside of the national authority they impact on. For example, a computer virus may be written in East Asia but cause damage in Europe, or a downloading site may be in Russia but accessed in the UK. This presents as many problems as possible for accurate measurements of cybercrime as it does for identifying offenders and bringing them to justice – particularly where other authorities have different legislation.</li><br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>Cybercrime can be undertaken on a large scale, potentially resulting in a relationship between victims and offenders that is quite different to ‘offline’ crime.</h4><p></p>
<p></p>
Unlike most traditional crimes, cybercrimes can be undertaken on a large scale and one offender may be linked to a vast number of smaller crimes (for example, a botnet which can send out masses of phishing emails). In most of these situations the offender would be perceived as largely anonymous by the victim. Furthermore, when aggregated, these smaller offences may still create a substantial return for the offender. Data collection and recording in this area will therefore face challenges in linking together seemingly isolated incidents. Part of the work of the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau seeks to draw together the linkages and commonalities between isolated incidents into ‘packages’ of intelligence for local police and other partner agencies to investigate.</li><br/>

		<font color = "blueviolet"><h3>Improving the quality and range of cybercrime measures there are two basic and important measures of interest for cybercrime:</h3></font><br/>
		<p></p>
1.<ul>measurements in terms of its overall prevalence or volume</ul>
2.<ul>measurements in terms of its overall impact (i.e., harm or cost).</ul><br/>
<p></p>
Improving measurement and recording is critical to understanding whether the scale of cybercrime is increasing or decreasing and how the nature of the problem is evolving over time. Without a better understanding, it is hard to allocate the right resources to different issues and to recognise what is working and what is not. Only when the quality and range of measures for several types of cyber offending are improved, will some of the remaining evidence gaps around the scale and nature of cybercrime begin to be resolved.There are key questions that need resolving to improve measures of cybercrime.<br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>What are the priority offences that need to be measured in relation to cybercrime?</h4><br/>
<p></p>
Considering the wide range of possible offending categories covered by cybercrime, some offence types may be of greater interest or concern than others.</li><br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>What are the best and most reliable indicators to use, considering the limited data in this field? How could these indicators be improved?</h4></li><br/>
<p></p>
<h4><li>Systematically improving the quality and range of individual measures of cybercrime.</h4><br/>
<p></p>
An overall measure of cybercrime (especially one that is built on inferior quality sub measures) is not likely to have much value. Whilst a general measure might seem an appealing exercise – if only to acquire a snapshot of the overall threat – cyber related offences are, by their nature all quite different and reflect a broad range of offences. Focusing on improving the individual measures of diverse types of cyber crime would therefore seem a more productive first step. Markedly improving and expanding data on prevalence will also be a prerequisite to developing more informed estimates of cost. Cost measures will only be as good as the building blocks upon which they are based. Improving measures of prevalence is therefore where the Home Office has been placing most of its recent efforts. The introduction of Action Fraud means that some types of cybercrimes are more systematically identified and recorded. To capture more information on types of cybercrimes not covered by Action Fraud, the Home Office:<br/>
<p></p>
o<ol> Has introduced a voluntary cyber ‘flag’ onto police recorded crime.</ol><br/>
<p>
o <ol>Is encouraging new questions to be added to the Commercial Victimisation Survey and the Crime Survey for England and Wales</ol><br/>
<p>
o <ol>Will continue to review the effectiveness of these improvements.</ol><br/>
<p></p>
<font color = "blueviolet"><h3>Filling other knowledge gaps. The review identified a number of areas where there is little evidence available, for example:</h3></font><br/>
<p></p>
<img src = "troll.png" align = "right" width = "300" height = "150">
<ol>
╩<ol> Online drug dealing (both illegal and prescription drugs).</ol><br/>
<p>
╩<ol> Online hate crime, defamation, and ‘trolling.’</ol><br/>
<p>
╩<ol> Online stalking.</ol><br/>
<p>
╩<ol> Use of the internet for human trafficking/smuggling.</ol><br/>
<p>
╩<ol> Second life or ‘virtual world’ crimes (for example, online ‘crimes’ undertaken by avatars [a manifestation of an individual’s online identity, controlled and created by the user] in virtual and game play worlds)</ol><br/>
<p>
╩<ol> Online or virtual currency (such as Bitcoin [untraceable digital banknotes with financial value which can be traded online for goods and services or exchanged for offline, real-world currency]).</ol><br/>
</ol>
<p></p>
These topics have not, yet, been extensively researched in the published. literature. However, they are areas that are likely to present increasing and new. challenges for legislation and law enforcement, and will need consideration as part of future measures of cybercrime. Hacking and phishing remain prevalent threats in the realm of cybercrimes, posing significant risks to individuals and organizations. Understanding the methods, impacts, and preventive measures associated with these tactics is crucial in establishing robust cybersecurity defenses. Implementing proactive security measures, ongoing employee training, and cultivating a cybersecurity-conscious culture are vital steps in mitigating the risks associated with hacking and phishing.
